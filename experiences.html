			<h2>American Marketing Association</h2>
		<p>I have been a member of AMA my entire college career. During my sophomore year, I was elected onto the exec board as VP of Public Relations, where I was in charge of our chapter's branding on social media. I created content to engage club members and attract new members to our club. Here's some of my favorite pieces of content I made for Instagram (@AMABadgers): </p>

			<p>My junior year, I was elected to be our club's Vice President, where I worked closely with the President, business school, AMA nationals, and AMA Madison (the professional chapter for marketers in Madison) to keep operations running smoothly within the club. I also was in charge of creating, forming, and running 5 new committees that helped members engage in creative problem solving and working on marketing tasks to support AMA.</p>

				<h2>Marketing and Multibrand Strategy Director for ThreadPort, InternationalTie, and UrbanAugust</h2>
				<p>This past summer, I worked with an entrepreneur to help with the marketing and brand strategy for a new e-commerce brand, ThreadPort, while contributing to the branding of his existing brands, InternationalTie and UrbanAugust. In this position, I:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Developed and optimized ad campaigns using Meta and TikTok Ads Manager</li>
					<li>Contributed to a 32% YOY sales increase and over $100k sales in Amazon for UrbanAugust and InternationalTie</li>
					<li>Increased brand credibility by providing timely and professional customer service, boosting Amazon reviews for all three brands by at least half a star</li>
					<li>Drove the creative direction of all 3 brands through photoshoots, web design, and content creation that drove customer engagement</li>
				<p>Here's a couple of ads and posts I created for InternationalTie and ThreadPort. This content helped increase brand awareness and attract new and returning customers to shop for our products!</p>

					<p>If you're interested in seeing more of the work I did for these brands, you can visit <a href="https://threadport.com/">ThreadPort's Website</a>, <a href="https://www.internationaltie.com/">InternationalTie's Website</a>, and <a href="https://urbanaugust.com/">UrbanAugust's Website</a> to see some of the pictures and web design I did. The websites also lead to each company's social media page which I also developed!</p>

				<h2>Marketing Intern at A Better Solution in Home Care</h2>
				<p>I also worked remotely as a marketing intern for A Better Solution in Home Care the spring of my junior year, where I helped the company find caregivers and clients through targeted social media ad campaigns. I also managed communications between leads, partners, and ABS corporate to facilitate regional business growth.</p>
