			<h2>American Marketing Association</h2>
		<p>I have been a member of AMA my entire college career. During my sophomore year, I was elected onto the exec board as VP of Public Relations, where I was in charge of our chapter's branding on social media. I created content to engage club members and attract new members to our club. </p>
			<p>My junior year, I was elected to be our club's Vice President, where I worked closely with the President, business school, AMA nationals, and AMA Madison (the professional chapter for marketers in Madison) to keep operations running smoothly within the club. I also was in charge of creating, forming, and running 5 new committees that helped members engage in creative problem solving and working on marketing tasks to support AMA.</p>
